## Retrospective (aka yapping)
First time developing with TDD. I quite enjoy the sense of security I have with the tests. No more self doubt about whether a change will break my existing model or not! I enjoyed the practice in separating model/view/controller as well. I made the separation much less convoluted compared to my todo-list. I also emphasized modularity in this project. I tried my best to decouple my functions from each other and use pure functions where I can.
